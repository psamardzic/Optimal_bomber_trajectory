# Optimal_bomber_trajectory

This repository contains the materials and code for my university term paper. Below is an overview of the included files and instructions for using the code.

## File Structure

- **`ulazni_podaci.m`**: This MATLAB file contains the input data required for running the program.
- **`atomska_bomba.m`**: This MATLAB file contains the code used for calculations and solving the problem.
- **`Bacanje_atomske_bombe.pdf`**: This PDF file includes a detailed explanation and analysis of the problem, proven methodology, and the results of the term paper.

## Running the Code

To run the program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that `ulazni_podaci.m` and `atomska_bomba.m` are in the same directory.
2. If you wish, edit `ulazni_podaci.m` while following the restrictions imposed in `Bacanje_atomske_bombe.pdf`
3. Save any changes and run the script in MATLAB using the line `atomska_bomba('ulazni_podaci.m')` (input data file is used as an argument of the main function
